# pinnace

> General multi-turn agent runtime with compaction, tools, and a Docker sandbox (Python).

Part of **[Eyry](https://eyry.io)** — open-source, agentic recon & offensive security tooling for
bug bounty hunters, red teamers, and pentesters. Pinnace is the agent engine the rest of the suite is built on. Hand it a prompt or seed and it runs.

## Status

🚧 **Early development.** Structure and APIs will change. Star/watch to follow along, and see
[eyry.io](https://eyry.io).

## What it does

- Persistent multi-turn agent loop with context compaction
- Built-in tool use, executed inside a Docker sandbox
- Usable standalone or driven by Quarterdeck / Aplomado

## Install

_Coming soon._
